## Analysis
The first scholion on the page ends Hector's invective against his brother. With this outpouring of emotion, Hecuba can understand how angry and exhausted Hector feels. The women of Troy are usually on the sidelines, but here, Hecuba feels that she has an opportunity to help. In Book 6, The scholiast provides multiple comments on the garments Hecuba sacrifices to Athena at the behest of her son Hector. Hecuba playacts a role that would have been familiar to the Athenian listeners. 
An elite woman oversees the sacrifices of textiles every year in Athens to the Pallas Athena.
ἀγελείη what does this epithet mean?
ποικίλμασιν- had a lot of work done on it, ornamentation?
κηώεις
 form of κηώεις, sweet smelling
the robes were placed for him
 ἐν ταῖς Ἀριστάρχου φερε καὶ ἑτέρως ἡ δ’ εἰς οῖκον ϊοῦσα παρίστατο φωριαμοῖσιν 
 Gregory Nagy argues that here is a "pervasive historical connection" between performances of Homeric epic and the Panathenaia. 
The enslaved women get a rare moment of acknowledgement. They bring a skill that it is implied the women of Troy do not have. They have special knowledge in a time when slaves were expected to only do the most menial of taks associated with weaving, and not exert creative control. Or could it just be a very valuable technique? but there is the implication of adornment.

θάλαμον
κάλλιστος ἔην ποικίλμασιν intricately worked
μέγιστος physically biggest? like something intended for a larger than life goddess?
what is the distinction between a treasure room and a bed chamber? or does it just mean private chamber? 
the gown underneath the rest
Has it never been worn? Is it being saved for something special?
παμποίκιλα there is power in the weaving, divine power, as garments dedicated for a goddess 
what happens to that aborted energy?
maybe large squares could be used for a variety of purposes? they don't have clearly established uses yet?
a particular meaning for the listeners at athens
Would they have been shocked to hear Athena refuse the gift,  so similar to the one they gave her every year?
There is a scarcity of scholarship on hecuba, much less her relationship with her son. HOmer is usually overshadowed by Euripides
