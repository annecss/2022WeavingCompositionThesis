## Analysis
The first scholion on the page ends Hector's invective against his brother. With this outpouring of emotion, Hecuba can understand how angry and exhausted Hector feels. The women of Troy are usually on the sidelines, but here, Hecuba feels that she has an opportunity to help. In Book 6, The scholiast provides multiple comments on the garments Hecuba sacrifices to Athena at the behest of her son Hector. Hecuba playacts a role that would have been familiar to the Athenian listeners.
