Woven Words in the Iliad: Gende, Narrative and Textile Production in the Venetus A Scholia
The work of previous scholars has established powerful connections between the process of creating textiles and process of epic oral composition. I will analyze how the scholia in one epic manuscript, the Venetus A, treat this issue and how it interplays with gender, specifically the female characters in the Iliad who produce textiles. I will focus on a few major sections of scholia and important scenes of weaving in the Iliad. The key female characters in the novel, both divine and human  nearly all have a scene or allusion to weaving.
