# An Initial Comparision of three key passages in the Iliad dealing with weaving and they're accompanying scholia.
## Helen weaves a tragedy 3.125-128
τὴν δ’ εὗρ’ ἐν μεγάρῳ· ἡ δὲ μέγαν ἱ̈στὸν ὕφαινε
δίπλακα μαρμαρέην· πολέας δ’ ἐνέπασσεν ἀέθλους
In this scholia, Helen stands in Priam's house weaving what she sees below. There are sevral factors to consider here. The first is that this act of weavin gprovides a rare opportunity for the gaze to thrift. Through weaving what she sees, the Iliad offes a different perspectice. TO HElen, the battlefield is a a mess and she represents both the surging motion of the armies and the blood and gore through the choice of colors in her weaving. Through her woven narrative, the reader is able to see the battle from a new perspective. Later Helen will hold the narrative under her gaze as she describes to Priam what is happening on the battlefield. 
## Athena and Garments of Power 14.178-181
This passage offers valuable information into the constrution and use of garments. This passage describes the garment that Hera puts on in order to seduce her husband Zeus. Athena appaears indirectly as the creator of this garment, perhsps the finest we see in the Iliad. The technical language here not only describes the garment, but offers information about the goddesses who are involved with it, as creators and wearers. The material of this robe is pecified as likely linene, and we get more detail about it than perhaps an other garment, unless we count Achilles' new armor as a garment. 
## Andromache avoids the outside world 22. 440-448
In this scene, Andromache has closed herself off from the world, but the world still manages to find her. Unlike, Heln, she is not an active participant, weaving what she sees, but rather what shes wish she could see. Her garment, with its symbols of peace and wealth is designed for a world that is very much in danger.  She knows that the Acheaens are at the walls and if they break the walls, her weaving will be futile, but she is so determined to believe that everything is alright that she weaves anyway. Weaving is the normal activtiy expected of her, and she is going to perform that normal activity. She weaves flowers, but the word could also mean charms or drugs. It could be a love charm for her husband.Key langugue is repeated from the Helen scene in book 3, even as the context is very different. Helen and Andromache both set about their work in the same way.. 
## Key Connections
The passages of Helen and Andromache struck me the first time that I read the Iliad. I discovered the Athena passage later, as I became more interested in the technical terms associated with weaving. Heln and Andromache are such different charcters, with different desires, but with such compelling similairities that these scenes where theu perform this daily work, this ritual, and interprest it in their own ways becomes compelling as a revelation of their character. MOreover, these women, while they speak infreuently thave tchance to express themselvest hrough what is not only a practical and valuable household good, but we can consider wa owrk of art.None of them women are making bedsheets or dishrags or ordinary households goods. Theya re creating something unique, something that narrative recongzes as avaluable. wE CANT'S EE INTO the lvies of ancient women. The cloth wthat women tohusands of years ago, unlike pottery or armor or sculpture fades away with the passage of time. With that women also fade from narratives that are written, as the Iliad was, and composed most likely by groups of  men. The Iliad is considerd this poem of manly things, maen's actions, men's choices, and indeed the central charcters who drive the plot forward are mostly and we get the most indepth view into their interiorty and they difficiult choices they have to make. But in these spearate, yet connected moments we can threads of lives and of storeis that the passage of time and purposeful erasure or thoughtless exlcusion have for the most part taken from us. This is not say that women's work and these stories of Helen, Athena, AND Andromache are only valuble to women readsers. They are valuble to everyone, . Our sculutre is so seprate from the ancient Greeks, and their culture was eparte from themytholigcal epics they constructed that  that instead of them sim ply influencing our ideads and our culture we impose our cultural ideas aback on them. Snd on e consistent cultural practice is the eclusion of women, and so these scenes are important in allowing us amore complesx view of the ancient world, of their storeis, of ourselves and like in liberatory reading practices what we might think and how might aplly our knoweldge in the future.
