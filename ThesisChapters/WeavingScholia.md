## Helen weaves a tragedy 3.125-128
τὴν δ’ εὗρ’ ἐν μεγάρῳ· ἡ δὲ μέγαν ἱ̈στὸν ὕφαινε
δίπλακα μαρμαρέην· πολέας δ’ ἐνέπασσεν ἀέθλους
In this scholia, Helen stands in Priam's house weaving what she sees below. There are several factors to consider here. The first is that this act of weaving g provides a rare opportunity for the gaze to thrift. Through weaving what she sees, the Iliad offers a different perspective. To Helen, the battlefield is a a mess and she represents both the surging motion of the armies and the blood and gore through the choice of colors in her weaving. Through her woven narrative, the reader is able to see the battle from a new perspective. Later Helen will hold the narrative under her gaze as she describes to Priam what is happening on the battlefield. Such weaving, according to Susan Edmunds , in "Picturing Homeric Weaving", would not be entrusted to slaves, instead, Helen holds a "quasi-priestly office".
## Athena and Garments of Power 14.178-181

ἔξυσεν : ** ἐκέρκισεν ξύουσι γὰρ τὴν κρόκην προς τὸ πυκνωθῆναι . οἱ δὲ ἐλέανεν ἀπο μεταφορᾶς τῶν ξύλων· οἱ δὲ ἀντι τοῦ ἔγναψεν μετα τὸ ὑφανθῆναι :
This passage offers valuable information into the construction and use of garments. This passage describes the garment that Hera puts on in order to seduce her husband Zeus. Athena appears indirectly as the creator of this garment, perhaps the finest we see in the Iliad. The technical language here not only describes the garment, but offers information about the goddesses who are involved with it, as creators and wearers. The material of this robe is specified as likely linen, and we get more detail about it than perhaps any other garment, unless we count Achilles' new armor as a garment. She plied the loom with a shuttle, scraping it, to make it close-woven? I think the next sentence is talking about the grinding down of wood? I can't figure out ὑφανθῆναι.
The first word of the scholia is a gloss on the lemma, ἔξυσ',expanding it into ἔξυσεν. This word comes from ξύω, which means to scratch, scrape, or shape by whittling. This is a very weird word. What is Athena doing with wood exactly? The next word, ἐκέρκισεν, I believe means to ply the loom but I couldn't fi the lexicon entry for the verb.
-The orignal word is elided but the lemma is not, suggesting that something has been replaced or changed in the text. 
Modern linen makers refer to the term of scutching, scraping the flax fibers to get rid of the tiny hairs and produce a small high quality fiber. I believe ἔξυσεν refers to this, and the gloss offers an alternate more widly known verb. Glosses are according to Churik a continous commentary on the translation, a metaphrase.  We know the scribe only glosses difficult and unfamiliar words. THere are very few interlinear scholia in book 14, a phenomen known as commentator fatigue. 
There is also an interior scholia, indiciated by a diple. 
ἔξυσεν is equivelent to (rest of scholia) 
ἐκέρκισεν is working with the shuttle
-oti alludes to critical sign
-προς plus infinitive = purpose
οἱ δὲ - but others say
ἔγναψεν-technical term, depilling, getting rid of stray fibers. This term is not in the LSJ.
ἀντι-instead of 
ἐλέανεν -she smoothed, A metaphor from woodwork
