Bolling provides an etymological analysis of two important, but confusing terms as they are used in the Iliad and Odyssey. He explains that the nouns ποικίλος and θρονος refer not only to human-created decorative features, but to materials embedded with spiritual power.

Dickey's indispensable guide to ancient scholarship provides a general overview of the flourishing field of ancient Greek textual commentary and specific information on major works, such as the known scholars of Homer. I relied on Chapter One, the "Introduction to Ancient Scholarship", Chapter 2 through 2.1.1.3 for its information on various sources of ancient scholarship on Homer, and Chapters 4 and 5 for assistance on learning the tricky scholarly Greek of the scholia and the accompanying practice materials. The appendices were also particularly helpful.

Edmunds explores what the craft of weaving might have meant to the audiences of Homer, explaining common tools and techniques, and discussing their literary significance. Her discussion of the κερκίς was particularly fascinating in relation to Andromache as a symbol of her power.

There were multiple helpful chapters in this book.
- "We need to avoid discussing ancient sources with modern concepts and terms of textile technology in mind. The construction of a weave, at least since medieval times, differs considerably from that of antiquity." (B)orders in Ancient Weaving and Archaic Greek Poetry
Tha authors investigate the relationship between textile terms and the production of knowledge, and knowledge itself, in ancient texts. There is a common theme of pattern creation that converses between textiles and sung works.

Ferrera provides a nuanced discussion on the color purple originating from sea snails and its close association with textiles and ritual offerings. Garments were important votive objects, and purple garments were historically sacrificed to Hera and Athena.
