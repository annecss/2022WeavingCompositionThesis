-missing longer discussion? transmission problem?
Here, the scholiast is explaining why the poet does not get into the emotional ramifications of Andromache hearing about Hector's death. He cautions the reader to think that Andromache is unfeeling, only that it is not the proper narrative moment for the poet to pause and explore her emotions. Andromache will have her full moment of public lament, alongside Hecuba and Helen, in Book 24. 
### 22.441
ποικίλ’ έπασσεν· πάσσειν Κύπριοι τὸ ποικίλλειν ἀφ οῦ παστὸς ὁ θάλαμος
Κύπριοι - subject, no conjugated verb, say/use
πάσσειν as synonm/equated for ποικίλλειν 
ἀφ οῦ- from which
she sprinkles in versicolored [flowers] the verb "to sprinkle in", has a Cypriot origin, meaning "to work in multucolored things", and from whi we get the noun "fancy bedchamber" which means "decorated bedchamber"
This passage is not simply an ethnographic origin of a term, but has fascinating implications for what Andromache is weaving. The scholia talks about the bridal chamber, also known as the women's chamber. Homer is using the Cyproit sense of the word.

ὥσπερ ἐλεῶν - as if he were pitying her ignorance

The poet pities Andromache, according to the scholiast. She does not, or cannot, understand what his happening outside her μυχῷ δόμου. Homer rarely calls out a character by name. νηπίη can be perjorative, but here it is pitying.

This passage refers back to book 6 with the word  ἐπίπληξις, how Andromache rebuked Hector before he went to the gates of Troy.
she heard the cacaphony. insted of hearing the noise, it is debated. rather, they say, her rebuke of him in book 6
## Andromache avoids the future 22.44
In this scene, Andromache has closed herself off from the world, but the world still manages to find her. Unlike, Heln, she is not an active participant, weaving what she sees, but rather what shes wish she could see. Her garment, with its symbols of peace and wealth is designed for a world that is very much in danger.  She knows that the Acheaens are at the walls and if they break the walls, her weaving will be futile, but she is so determined to believe that everything is alright that she weaves anyway. Weaving is the normal activtiy expected of her, and she is going to perform that normal activity. She weaves flowers, but the word could also mean charms or drugs. It could be a love charm for her husband.Key langugue is repeated from the Helen scene in book 3, even as the context is very different. Helen and Andromache both set about their work in the same way.. Hector dies before he can ever see this garment though, and he will only feel the touch of the robes the color of royalty in death, in line 24. 796, as his countrymen cover his bones with purple cloth.

## Key Connections
The passages of Helen and Andromache struck me the first time that I read the Iliad. I discovered the Athena passage later, as I became more interested in the technical terms associated with weaving. Helen and Andromache are such different characters, with different desires, but with such compelling similairities that these scenes where they perform this daily work, this ritual, and how they interpet it in their own ways becomes compelling as a revelation of their character. Moreover, these women, while they speak infrequently thave tchance to express themselvest hrough what is not only a practical and valuable household good, but we can consider wa owrk of art. None of them women are making bedsheets or dishrags or ordinary households goods. They are creating something unique, something that narrative recognizes as valuable. We can’t see into the lives of ancient women. The cloth wthat women thousands of years ago, unlike pottery or armor or sculpture fades away with the passage of time. With that women also fade from narratives that are written, as the Iliad was, and composed most likely by groups of  men. The Iliad is considered this poem of manly things, maen's actions, men's choices, and indeed the central characters who drive the plot forward are mostly and we get the most indepth view into their interiority and they difficiult choices they have to make. But in these spearate, yet connected moments we can threads of lives and of storeis that the passage of time and purposeful erasure or thoughtless exlcusion have for the most part taken from us. This is not say that women's work and these stories of Helen, Athena, AND Andromache are only valuable to women readers. They are valuable to everyone . Our culture is so separate from the ancient Greeks, and their culture was separated from the mythological epics they constructed that instead of them simply influencing our ideas and our culture we impose our cultural ideas on them. Snd one consistent cultural practice is the exclusion of women, and so these scenes are important in allowing us a more complex view of the ancient world, of their stories, of ourselves and like in liberatory reading practices what we might think and how might apply our knowledge in the future.

George Bolling She weaves roses for Hector, a protective symbol like the real flower's thorns.Bolling cites a scholiast on Theocr. 2. 59, commenting on X 441, who believed (in summary): "(1) That different flowers secured different blessings for their wearers; (2) that roses brough one's man back safe and sound to the one who wore them; (3) that Andromache's mοst intense wish was for the safety of Hector." (Bolling, 281) This suggests that the term _θρονα_ would have special significance to the bard's listeners.
The scholiast confirms Bolling's assumption about how Homer creates Andromache into a pathetic figure.
