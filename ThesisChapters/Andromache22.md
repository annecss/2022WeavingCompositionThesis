The main scholia, out of these twenty-four lines, center on just ten lines. It is Andromache's ignorance

and so she weaves her web/at her loom
οτι-because
lack of sympathy/feeling 
θορυβῳ-confusion
ατρεμουσα-being calm, not trembling
ταυτα?
not unknowing of the approach of Achilles
^^ problem diple is dealing with
aristarchus says poet probably completely made use of the character of andromache
the communication/dialogue (with hector?)
απεσχισθαι-m/p infinitive
even now
her countenance
ουν-explains problem
προκαταχρησαμενος-causal, because
not the moment to pause and explain who andromache is 
ἐζήτηται - it is debated
beginning might be aristarchus, middle is add on from later scholar replacing longer argument of aristarchus
-missing longer discussion? transmission problem?
Here, the scholiast is explaining why the poet does not get into the emotional ramifications of Andromache hearing about Hector's death. He cautions the reader to think that Andromache is unfeeling, only that it is not the proper narrative moment for the poet to pause and explore her emotions. Andromache will have her full moment of public lament, alongside Hecuba and Helen, in Book 24. 
### 22.441
ποικίλ’ έπασσεν· πάσσειν Κύπριοι τὸ ποικίλλειν ἀφ οῦ παστὸς ὁ θάλαμος
Κύπριοι - subject, no conjugated verb, say/use
πάσσειν as synonm/equated for ποικίλλειν 
ἀφ οῦ- from which
she sprinkles in versicolored [flowers] the verb "to sprinkle in", has a Cypriot origin, meaning "to work in multucolored things", and from whi we get the noun "fancy bedchamber" which means "decorated bedchamber"
This passage is not simply an ethnographic origin of a term, but has fascinating implications for what Andromache is weaving. The scholia talks about the bridal chamber, also known as the women's chamber. Homer is using the Cyproit sense of the word. 
### 22.445-449
ἡδ’ αῦτις δμωῇσι αὔξει τὸ πάθ , τοσοῦτον γὰρ ἀπέχει τοῦ ἐννοεῖν τί τῶν συμβεβηκότων ὡς καὶ λουτρὰ τῷ ἀνδρὶ παρασκευάζειν μονονουχὶ ὁρῶσα τὸν Ἕκτορα διὸ καὶ (ἐπεφώνησεν ὁ ποιητὴς) τὸ  (νηπίη οὐδ’ ἐνόησεν) ὥσπερ ἐλεῶν τὴν ἄγνοιαν αὐτῆς
long horizontal line-parapgrafos, marks direct speech
αὔξει-we speak of the poet in present tense
 this comment increases the pathos
γὰρ
ἐννοεῖν - away from, with τοῦ , using genitvie as infinitive, speaker is so far from understanding τί , 
συμβεβηκότων- the things that have happened
ὡς καὶ - natural result clause, os plus inf. 
kai- adverbial
νηπίη οὐδ’ ἐνόησεν-quoted
this kind of direct address by the poet is uncommon
nepios in other contexts is perjoritvae, but here is pitying
μονονουχὶo-only because, practically, hasn’t quite
ουχὶ-emphatic
διὸ καὶ- for this reason, switching subject
τὸ-quoted phrases, like quotation marks
ὥσπερ ἐλεῶν - as if he were pitying her ignorance
she can all but see hector
oti- explains critical sign, cannonball symbol
The poet pities Andromache, according to the scholiast. She does not, or cannot, understand what his happening outside her μυχῷ δόμου. Homer rarely calls out a character by name. νηπίη can be perjorative, but here it is pitying.

This passage refers back to book 6 with the word  ἐπίπληξις, how Andromache rebuked Hector before he went to the gates of Troy.
she heard the cacaphony. insted of hearing the noise, it is debated. rather, they say, her rebuke of him in book 6
