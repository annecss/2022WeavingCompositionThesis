# An Initial Comparision of three key passages in the Iliad dealing with weaving and they're accompanying scholia.
## Helen weaves a tragedy 3.125-128
In this scholia, Helen stands in PRiam's house weaving what she sees below. There are sevral factors to consider here. The first is that this act of weavin gprovides a rare opportunity tfo rthe gaze to thrift. Through weaving what she sees, the Iliad offes a different perspectice. TO HEln, it is a a mess. Later Helen will hold the narrative under her gaze as she describes to Priam what is happening on the battlefield. The color theory is essntail here.
## Athena and the best garment ever 14.178-181
This passage offers valuable information into the constrution and use of garments. This passage lingers over the garment that Hera puts on. Athena appaears indirectly as the creator of this garment, perhsps the finest we see in the Iliad. 
## Andromache avoids the outside world 22. 440-448
In this scene, Andromache has closed herself off from the world, but the world still manages to find her. She weaves flowers. Key langugue is repated from the Helen scene in book 3. 
## Key Connections
The passages of Helen and Andromache struck me the first time that I read the Iliad.
