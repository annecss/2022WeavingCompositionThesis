## Athena and Garments of Power 14.178-186

ἔξυσεν : ** ἐκέρκισεν ξύουσι γὰρ τὴν κρόκην προς τὸ πυκνωθῆναι . οἱ δὲ ἐλέανεν ἀπο μεταφορᾶς τῶν ξύλων· οἱ δὲ ἀντι τοῦ ἔγναψεν μετα τὸ ὑφανθῆναι : This passage offers valuable information into the construction and use of garments. This passage describes the garment that Hera puts on in order to seduce her husband Zeus. Athena appears indirectly as the creator of this garment, perhaps the finest we see in the Iliad. The technical language here not only describes the garment, but offers information about the goddesses who are involved with it, as creators and wearers. The material of this robe is specified as likely linen, and we get more detail about it than perhaps any other garment, unless we count Achilles' new armor as a garment. She plied the loom with a shuttle, scraping it, to make it close-woven? I think the next sentence is talking about the grinding down of wood? I can't figure out ὑφανθῆναι. The first word of the scholia is a gloss on the lemma, ἔξυσ',expanding it into ἔξυσεν. This word comes from ξύω, which means to scratch, scrape, or shape by whittling. This is a very weird word. What is Athena doing with wood exactly? The next word, ἐκέρκισεν, I believe means to ply the loom but I couldn't fi the lexicon entry for the verb. -The orignal word is elided but the lemma is not, suggesting that something has been replaced or changed in the text. Modern linen makers refer to the term of scutching, scraping the flax fibers to get rid of the tiny hairs and produce a small high quality fiber. I believe ἔξυσεν refers to this, and the gloss offers an alternate more widly known verb. Glosses are according to Churik a continous commentary on the translation, a metaphrase. We know the scribe only glosses difficult and unfamiliar words. THere are very few interlinear scholia in book 14, a phenomen known as commentator fatigue. There is also an interior scholia, indiciated by a diple. ἔξυσεν is equivelent to (rest of scholia) ἐκέρκισεν is working with the shuttle -oti alludes to critical sign -προς plus infinitive = purpose οἱ δὲ - but others say ἔγναψεν-technical term, depilling, getting rid of stray fibers. This term is not in the LSJ. ἀντι-instead of ἐλέανεν -she smoothed, A metaphor from woodwork
## Aphrodite's belt 14.214-223
SAfter adorning herself with Athen'as fine garment, and other accessories, Hera goes to Aphrodite for the final, and most importna piece in her retinue. ἱμάντα is an unusual word
Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite started the war. They are on opposite sides, Hera and Athena with the Greeks, Aphrodite with the Trojans. On Olympus though, their conflict is brushed aside with the silky smoothness of fine garments. This episode centers around Her'as efforts to seduce Zeus so that. Her former competitors come to her aid, even as Aphrodite helps the opposing side. Yet, Hera lies to Aphrodite.
After the discussion of Athena's garment, Hera asks Aphrodite if she can borrow Aphrodite's famous belt, which can enchant lovers. The term ἐμπεπυκιλμένης is particularely noteworthy. The presence of love and sweet words have been summoned into existence with a woman's weaving tools. The belt is woven, not embroidered.People think poikilos means embroidery, but the real foucs is the presence of the spirtual in the physical creation. The poet isnt' specifying a type of physical creation, but the merger of normal physical with spiritual creation.
