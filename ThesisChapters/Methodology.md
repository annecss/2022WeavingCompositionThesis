# Methodology
The scholia of Homeric manuscripts are diverse, underexplored, and unwieldy. The Venetus A has approximately  ten thousand, from two different major scholarly traditions covering every topic from the material in a sword to the proper shade of light in the dawn to the editor's complaints about former scholars. While the Venetus A scholia have been edited and published, only a few have been have actually been closely read. That's not surprising given  the dense technical language, uncommon abbreviations and challenging grammatical syntax. 

Yet, for a scholar, this material, for these reasons, is a treasure trove of possibility. I want to work with this original material and understand not just what the Iliad has to say about weaving, my chosen topic, but how this topic emerges across the century of scholarship that the scholia record. Of course, there are risks. This topic may have been utterly uninteresting to scholars like Aristarchus, Didymus, and Zenodotus. My background reading on weaving in Ancient Greek culture leads me to hope that they won't, but of course, working with understudied material, my hope is by default not grounded in firm evidence. My methods will begin by using text search notebooks applied to the Venetus A online corpus to find these scholia. After cataloging them and key weaving vocabulary words, my next step will be to perform a close reading on each scholion selected. It is yet to be determined whether I will include Venetus B scholia as well as Venetus A scholia. Finally, I will use topic modeling and word vectors, as well as other forms of digital analysis, to compare the scholia in relation to one another. This close reading, in combination with tech-enabled deeper understanding, will form the substance of my conclusions, and provide a model for future research methodology in Homeric scholia.

Any analysis of Homeric Scholia must first begin with the context of the Iliad passage it comments on.
- read the iliad passage, the preceeding and following lines
- brek the passage down into it's syntactical unites, spearted by the periods, high stops, and colons
The next step is to analyze the lemma. it is the reference point for all syntactical units
- translate as normal finding the main verb first, if there is nome assume eimi
- if there is not clear subject, then the lemma is probably the subject

-open question
-Aristarchus scholia and d scholia-maybe not a good categorization
-can we isolate distinctly aristarchan scholia?
-maybe focus on different channels, multiple traditions, within and outside of Aristarchan material
-only 80 percent of VA Scholia are included in erbse's edition, real issue for scholars
