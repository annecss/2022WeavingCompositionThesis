Iris' visit to Helen in Book 3 introduces a dramatic shift in narrative and a rare moment of female power in the Iliad, Helen's τειχοσκοπία. It all begins at a loom, in a rather unexpected location, along with an unnerving creation. In this scholia, Helen stands in Priam's house weaving what she sees below. Helen’s act of weaving in lines 121-128 represents the first detailed depiction of textile creation in the Iliad, and a shift to a new perspective. Iris, messenger of the gods, appears to Helen in the guide of her sister-in-law, Laodice, and invites her to step away from the loom where she works.
The first notable aspect of this passage is Helen’s location: ἐν μεγάρῳ. The μέγαρον, or great hall, is not the typical place one would expect to find a loom, or a woman working it. Later, in 6.325 Hector finds Helen weaving next to Paris in the θάλαμος of Paris’ palace. In the world of the Iliad, this is the more appropriate place, as Hecuba in 6 and Andromache in 22 both carry out their textitle related missions in the θάλαμος. The μέγαρον is a public space, for speeches and decrees, feasting and gift giving, the gathering place where men dominate the social influx. Of course, women would be there, at the side of men, if they were elites, or more likely, as slaves bringing food and drink and cutting across the room on various errands. Of course, textile work demanded the constant time and energy of even elite women. In the Odyssey, both Helen and Arete bring out their wool baskets as they sit and listen to the men tell their stories, always keeping their hands busy as a proper wife should. Yet, this is not the space to set up a loom. A loom like the one Helen would have worked on is a heavy, bulky technology, and would have occupied a notable workspace, as it would have required stores of thread nearby, and the constant moving presence off slave women nearby spinning or fetching thread and wool from elsewhere in the palace. As shown later in Book 22, Andromache weaves in a more appropriate location in 22.437, μυχῷ δόμου ὑψηλοῖο, a corner of the lofty house. There, she would not be disturbed, having the privacy to contemplate her work, unweaving and reweaving as necessary, and likewise not intruding on the other affairs of the household. Helen, instead, transgresses. A loom would not have accidentally or unconsciously been left in the megaros. Helen has an apartment she shares with Paris that would be the location those listening to the bard’s tale would expect. Yet, without an explanation, Helen and her work are on display for everyone to see. Later, in line 142 as Helen leaves with Iris the poet says she exitsἐκ θαλάμοιο. Did the poet mean that the two chambers are the same? Did she make a detour? Also her tears! She veils herself before she cries.
 The garment she weaves is a δίπλαξ, something with a double fold. With that double fold, we enter a double narrative, Helen’s story within the story, an alternate perspective, a wresting away of narrative control. Helen chose to weave what she saw. What thoughts passed through her head as she drew their wounds into the weft? She knows these men, their names and godly epithets and hometowns and families. Double folded, double meaning. Helen reveals and hides her intentions in those folds. 
The δίπλακα is described in the Venetus as μαρμαρέην, shining double-fold cloak. Yet, the scholia comments  δίπλακα μαρμαρέην καὶ αἱ Ἀριστάρχου καὶ ἡ Ζηνοδότου καὶ ἡ Ἀριστοφάνους πορφυρέην εἶχον , οὐ μαρμαρέην καὶ ἐστι πρεπωδέστερον καὶ γὰρ ἐπι τῶν νυμφῶν φάρε’ ὑφαίνουσι ἀλιπόρφυρα ⁑“according to Aristarchus, Zenodotus, and Aristophanes present as πορφυρέην, blood-colored, but μαρμαρέην, shining or flashing, is more fitting, for it is by done by the nymphs who weave a web of true sea purple.”  μαρμάρεος is a highly unusual term to describe a woven work. In the Iliad, it is used three times: when referring to the sea (14.273) Zeus’s aegis (17.594), and the shield made for Achilles (18.480) πορφυρέην is a much more common term, used for garments, death and blood, and the sea. πορφυρέην is commonly used in the standaridized version of the Iliad that we use today, and as the scribe notes, it seems to b e the common choice among ancient scholars.  How can a woven work have the quality of shining, of reflecting light, usually given to metal and water? Perhaps, the narrative emphasizes a more positive aspect of the battle scene: not wounds, but shining armor, like that of the Ἀχαιῶν χαλκοχιτώνων. With this unusual quality of light, the garment would still be transfixing even without the striking color of blood. Perhaps Helen is engaging in a form of transmutation, of turning metal into fiber, incorporating the oceanic origins into the work, literally reflecting them. Modern weavers sometimes do use metal coated threads, giving their fabric a shiny but stiff appearance. Could it be almost like armor? What goddess would want to wear a garment like this, though? 
The standard word, πορφυρέην, likewise introduces  many possibilities of challenging and intriguing meanings. Helen is undoubtedly working with the most rare and luxurious of materials, the sea purple essence of hexaplex trunculus, the sea snail whose gland produced the color purple.
the bitter gift
Gowns that color purple were often sacrificed to goddesses, and this may be exactly what Helen is doing. μέγαν ἱ̈στὸν a hint to the size of what she creates? a goddess gift perhaps? 
Beyond the unusual setting of this scene, there are several factors to consider here. The first is that this act of weaving provides a rare opportunity for the gaze to thrift. The scholar Bianca Ferrera has summarized three main semantic meanings for the color purple. "a symbol of divinity and expression of the priest's dignity" "a symbol of luxury and opulence", "a symbol of royalty and political power" Helen claims all three. Through weaving what she sees, the Iliad offers a different perspective: To Helen, the battlefield is a mess and she represents both the surging motion of the armies and the blood and gore through the choice of colors in her weaving. Through her woven narrative, the reader is able to see the battle from a new perspective. Later, Helen will hold the narrative under her gaze as she describes to Priam what is happening on the battlefield. Such weaving, according to Susan Edmunds , in "Picturing Homeric Weaving", would not be entrusted to slaves, instead, Helen holds a "quasi-priestly office" (Edumunds). And what a shocking work it is: a bloody-colored garment, depicting the battle scene below. That may be the answer to the mystery of the megaron. Perhaps Helen could have had a better view to record the bloodshed outside the gates from this location. Helen is doing is striking, and it could not have been done by slaves, who were not given that level of creative control. Susan Edmunds describes it as a “quasi-priestly office”. She has further cemented her position of power with her unconventional location. Their bloodshed is for her, and with her bloody garment, she makes it her own. And as she makes their tragedy into a work of art, she becomes the narrator of the story. She will tell the names to Priam and the old men of Troy, and to the reader. She holds the narrative in her grip, along with her κερκίς. 
We do not know if Helen ever finished her work. A woven work often took months, if not years to complete. Yet, we know Helen’s at least made close to a complete picture. When the Achaeans set their fires and race up the sloping streets to the palace, they will find waiting for them, in the delirium of their victory, only another reminder of the pain and suffering that they simultaneously bore and afflicted to achieve such an awesome victory. Eventually, Helen’s time as narrator will end with the appearance of Aphrodite, the goddess most similar to Helen herself. Maybe Helen has claimed too much power, dabbling too deep in this transfiguring magic. Helen weaves no magic charms of protection. 
Helen has been shamed. Here, she shames the goddesses. She has been called vain, been blamed for her beauty. They were the ones who fought whose jealousy and vanity and pettiness created this entire mess. All this for an apple? For another epithet, when they each have a long and flattering list already? All this bloodshed, women enslaved and cities burned? If it is a gift for a goddess, it is a bitter one.
Does Helen claim this position of visibility for a reason? Is this a communal garment, a common gift that everyone wishes to see the progress of? Helen never claimed to be the most beautiful woman in the world. She never asked for a war. The gods hunger for one, and their deaths bring great glory to the immortals.Is the flash of metal appropriate for a goddess? Does it make up for the tragedy> What the gods will see as a celebration of their power humans will recognize as an atrocity. Or is it guilt perhaps? People fight and die in Helen’s name, although the war is about so much more than just her. 
πολύδακρυν many tears an epithet often omitted


22.510 Andromache mentions that Hector has an εἵματ᾽, a garment, ἐνὶ μεγάροισι She was just weaving in a private chamber of the house though. Perhaps this references a different garment, one on display?
