Helen’s Weaving
Ἶρις δ᾽ αὖθ᾽ Ἑλένῃ λευκωλένῳ ἄγγελος ἦλθεν
εἰδομένη γαλόῳ Ἀντηνορίδαο δάμαρτι,
τὴν Ἀντηνορίδης εἶχε κρείων Ἑλικάων
Λαοδίκην Πριάμοιο θυγατρῶν εἶδος ἀρίστην.
τὴν δ᾽ εὗρ᾽ ἐν μεγάρῳ: ἣ δὲ μέγαν ἱστὸν ὕφαινε
δίπλακα μαρμαρέην, πολέας δ᾽ ἐνέπασσεν ἀέθλους
Τρώων θ᾽ ἱπποδάμων καὶ Ἀχαιῶν χαλκοχιτώνων,
οὕς ἑθεν εἵνεκ᾽ ἔπασχον ὑπ᾽ Ἄρηος παλαμάων:

## Helen weaves a tragedy 3.125-128
τὴν δ’ εὗρ’ ἐν μεγάρῳ· ἡ δὲ μέγαν ἱ̈στὸν ὕφαινε
δίπλακα μαρμαρέην· πολέας δ’ ἐνέπασσεν ἀέθλους
In this scholia, Helen stands in Priam's house weaving what she sees below. There are several factors to consider here. The first is that this act of weaving g provides a rare opportunity for the gaze to thrift. Through weaving what she sees, the Iliad offers a different perspective. To Helen, the battlefield is a a mess and she represents both the surging motion of the armies and the blood and gore through the choice of colors in her weaving. Through her woven narrative, the reader is able to see the battle from a new perspective. Later Helen will hold the narrative under her gaze as she describes to Priam what is happening on the battlefield. Such weaving, according to Susan Edmunds , in "Picturing Homeric Weaving", would not be entrusted to slaves, instead, Helen holds a "quasi-priestly office".
Helen’s act of weaving in lines 121-128 of Book Three of the Iliad represents the first detailed depiction of textile creation in the Iliad, and a shift to a new perspective. Iris, messenger of the gods, appears to Helen in the guide of her sister-in-law, Laodice, and invites her to step away from the loom where she works. The first notable aspect of this passage is Helen’s location: ἐν μεγάρῳ. The μέγαρον, or great hall, is not the typical place one would expect to find a loom, or a woman working it. It is a public space, for speeches and decrees, feasting and gift giving, the gathering place where men dominate the social influx. Of course, women would be there, at the side of men, if they were elites, or more likely, as slaves bringing food and drink and cutting across the room on various errands. Of course, textile work demanded the constant time and energy of even elite women. In the Odyssey, both Helen and Alcmene bring out their wool baskets as they sit and listen to the men tell their stories, always keeping their hands busy as a proper wife should.
Yet, this is not the space to set up a loom. A loom like the one Helen would have worked on is a heavy, bulky technology, and would have occupied a notable workspace, as it would have required stores of thread nearby, and the constant moving presence off slave women nearby spinning or fetching thread and wool from elsewhere in the palace. As shown later in Book 22, Andromache weaves in a more appropriate location in 22.437, μυχῷ δόμου ὑψηλοῖο, a corner of the lofty house. There, she would not be disturbed, having the privacy to contemplate her work, unweaving and reweaving as necessary, and likewise not intruding on the other affairs of the household.
Helen, instead, transgresses. A loom would not have accidentally or unconsciously been left in the megaros. Helen has an apartment she shares with Paris that would be the location those listening to the bard’s tale would expect. Yet, without an explanation, Helen and her work are on display for everyone to see. 
And what a shocking work it is: a bloody-colored garment, depicting the battle scene below. That may be the answer to the mystery of the megaron. Perhaps Helen could have had a better view to record the bloodshed outside the gates from this location. The work Helen is doing is striking, and it could not have been done by slaves, who were not given that level of creative control. Helen is undoubtedly working with the most rare and luxurious of materials, the essence of hexaplex trunculus, the sea snail whose gland produced the color purple. Susan Edmunds describes it as a “quasi-priestly office”.  She has further cemented her position of power with her unconventional location. The garment she weaves is a δίπλαξ, something with a double fold. WIth that double fold, we enter a double narrative, Helen’s story within the story, an alternate perspective, a wresting away of narrative control.
Helen chose to weave what she saw. What thoughts passed through her head as she drew their wounds into the weft? She knows these men, their names and godly epithets and hometowns and families. Their bloodshed is for her, and with her bloody garment, she makes it her own. Yet, the garment, in the Venetus A, is not blood-colored, but shining. 
δίπλακα μαρμαρέην καὶ αἱ Ἀριστάρχου καὶ ἡ Ζηνοδότου καὶ ἡ Ἀριστοφάνους πορφυρέην εἶχον , οὐ μαρμαρέην καὶ ἐστι πρεπωδέστερον καὶ γὰρ ἐπι τῶν νυμφῶν φάρε’ ὑφαίνουσι ἀλιπόρφυρα ⁑
πορφυρέην is not the suitable word here, no, μαρμαρέην is what Homer would have wanted. The δίπλακα μαρμαρέην, shining cloak, according Aristarchus, Zenodotus, and Aristophanes present as πορφυρέην, blood-colored, but μαρμαρέην, shining or flashing, is more fitting, for it is by done by the nymphs who weave a web of true sea purple.
μαρμάρεος is a highly unusual term to describe a woven work. In the Iliad, it is used three times: when referring to the sea (14.273) Zeus’s aegis (17.594), and the shield made for Achilles (18.480) πορφυρέην is a much more common term, used for garments, death and blood, and the sea. How can a woven work have the quality of shining, of reflecting light, usually given to metal and water? Perhaps, the narrative emphasizes a more positive aspect of the battle scene: not wounds, but shining armor, like that of the Ἀχαιῶν χαλκοχιτώνων. With this unusual quality of light, the garment would still be transfixing even without the striking color of blood. Perhaps Helen is engaging in a form of transmutation, of turning metal into fiber, incorporating the oceanic origins into the work, literally reflecting them. 
And as she makes their tragedy into a work of art, she becomes the narrator of the story. She will tell the names to Priam and the old men of Troy, and to the reader. She holds the narrative in her grip, along with her kerkis. We do not know if Helen ever finished her work. A woven work often took months, if not years to complete. Yet, we know Helen’s at least made close to a complete picture. When the Achaeans set their fires and race up the sloping streets to the palace, they will find waiting for them, in the delirium of their victory, only another reminder of the pain and suffering that they simultaneously bore and afflicted to achieve such an awesome victory. Eventually, Helen’s time as narrator will end with the appearance of Aphrodite, the goddess most similar to Helen herself. Maybe Helen has claimed too much power, dabbled to deep in this transfiguring magic.
Helen weaves no magic charms of protection.
