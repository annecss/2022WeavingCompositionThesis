## Future Directions
The work of the Holy Cross summer research team of 2021 revealed that thse manuscripts are a rich and intriguing source for topic modelling. 
As more and more manuscripts near completion, in the future we may hope to see topic model comparing the presence of weaving in the scholia across manuscripts.
"We know, of course, that this mentality of re-weaving gives way, in the course of time, to a web no longer re-woven. Once the weaving stops, the web can become a text. " (Nagy Plato, 115)
the act of weaving- the act of singing

## Conclusion
There is so much confusion, misunderstanding, and missing data surrounding ancient textiles. The scholia themselves sometimes feel like another layer of difficulty and obsfucation rather than a source of clarification. Yet, these scholia are so valuable. Theyre' really attempting to anser the same questions modern scholars are asking. These scribes one thousand years ago share the hunger of modern scholars for any insight we can get into to this epic material. Maybe in their confusion over textiles we can even pinpoint some more answers.
