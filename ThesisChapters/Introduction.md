Book 3, https://homermultitext.github.io/facsimiles/venetus-a/44r/
Helen weaves the battle scene she sees outside the walls. In scholia 3.126, the scribe justifies a word choice for the color/pattern of what Helen weaves. The color is particularly important as it may relate to either the divine aspect of Helen, and other types of art, and/or the impression of the scene she views.

Hecuba sacrifices a fine garment to Athena on behalf of Hector. The scholia on this page talk about the garment itself and the Sidonian women who created it and others.
