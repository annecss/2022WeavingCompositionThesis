- developing critical scholia list
http://www.homermultitext.org/facsimiles/venetus-a/33v/
- work on adding context to Iliad passages
- create ongoing vocab list
- Review different manuscripts: omega, townley, geneva 44 (not covered by erbse, ventetus a, vb, upsilon, florentine
How do we select what to read? Unfair advantage to the Venetus A, which has complete edition?
Methodology? starting with VA and going straight through? or branching out to check every scholia?
Next Meeting: vocab, questions, annotated scholia
At this meeting, we discussed the overall plan for the project and the specific work I will need to have prepared for next week. The most important work is to go through the Venetus A and document all scholia related to the three main weaving passages in the Iliad (3.125-130, 22.440-450). There are of course more mentions of weaving, but I think these are the most essential passages. Of course, that brings us to the issue of how to continue with my workflow. Do I focus entirely on the VA? Or start branching out to other manuscripts, and if so, which ones?

- fixed mechanical issue: spaces, add .md to files
- need to review Iliad 24, as well as do a thorough vocabulary search
- For next tuesday, I need to (1) find passages in Venetus B and see if anything is relevant to the Venetus A commentary and (2) I need to write up an initial commentary on these three passages on place of act of weaving and woven garment in their parituclar passage, and what scholiasts chooses to explain/comment on. Summarize compare contrast of the different scenes of weaving and woven material, what the scholiasts want to think about
-update vocabulary list

-Weaving is a standard female activity in the Iliad. One expects to see men fighting or arguing, and one expects to see women weaving or crying. But what these women are weaving is by no means generic. Rather, three instances of female weaving, Helen in Book 3, Athena in Book 14, and Andromache in book 24 , reveal in-depth information into the characters' status, emotions, and preeocupations while the are narratively and nominatively silent. The scholia in Venetus serve to further expand on these messages physically coded into the womens' handicrafts.
Helen occupies an complicated position as a weaver and foreign woman in the court of Priam. She is not a slave, rather, the scene of her weaving shows her in a place of high honor.
Athena's weaving, told through her scene with Hera, shows her own divine power. She is unique in that her weaving is specified as a gift for a particular person, Hera.
Finally, Andromache's weaving reveals the complex feelings she cannot express and serves as a multi-layered portent of the terrible future that presses in on her from outside the walls that protect her.

-Bibtex, zotero
-Task: revise Venetus A pages of note, Prof. Smith will set up repository on Thursday

-Nagy notes that the θρόνα Andromache sprinkles in could refer to flowers, or, more intriguingly, to love-charms. If they are these charms, that could be a tie-in to Hector.

-citing orthographic system: not enough to say something is digital
-they way a text is encoded should express the semantics of the text so that it can be tokenized
-first token of Iliad: μηνιν, a leixcal token
-funny fishtail: punctuation token, even if it looks like a comma plus semicolon, it just one token
-tokens are not just charcters, but are always classified
-for line of Iliad: create tokenized edition, add another level to citation hierarchy VA1.1.1: μηνιν
analyze VA1.1.1 with orthographic system, it will tell you it is a lexical token TLG012-Homeric poetry 1-Iliad
.msa 
-alt edition generated automatically: tlg12.tlgoo1.msadiplomatic, scribal for things like sic/corr
-we have: orginal diplomatic edition, scribal version(acknowledigng scribes version, like with replaced words, or offering two readings(we take on on line as diplomatic, superscript as scirbal alternative)) modern editorial normalization(acknowleding unintellagible passages///misspellings, our own readings, connecting byzantine orthogrpahy with normal readings)
-encoding multivalent (multiple possible readings) documents and generating univocal editions
-strong feelings about using tei to get to something else
-we use tei to encode the texts and get the univocal editions
-can use univocal editoins reduce to text with no markup and cts urn
- we have two parellel vers of texts with same passage citations, but different version components
- urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012: 3rd compoenent name space: 4th work, 5th passage(cna be empty, but can't leave out end colon
- urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5026:msAim.hmt:3- all intermarginal scholia in book 3 of HMT's Venetus a 
- 3.51r_1-book 3 51 recto scholia 1
- -3.209.comment (numbered scholia) 3 lexical tokens, 1 punction token
- orthographic system lets us tokenize our text
- urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5026.msAint.tokens:3.209.comment.1 - 
- orthogrpyhy, og that tokenizes and class, once youve cl and tk you can apply a parsing system
- -we need the analytical corpus:citable corpus,w orthogrpahic system, and parsing system, must be coordinated
- if you have all 3, you can drop in one line EVERYTHING
- -the NICE tokenized edition
