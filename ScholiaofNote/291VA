andromache

κωκυτοῦ δ’ ήκουσεν .
 ἀντι τοῦ θρήνου ήκουσεν
 ἐζήτηται δὲ πῶς τοσοῦτου γενομένου θορύβου μόλις Ἀνδρομάχη προῆλθεν . 
φασὶ δὲ ὡς ὅτι ἡ προτέρα τοῦ ἀνδρὸς ἐπίπληξις ἡ εν τῆ Ζ σωφρονεῖν αὐτὴν ἀναγκάζει

-genitive object of source of sound, normally a person
anti- instead of
θρήνου- more common word for sound readers might knwo
ἐζήτηται - refers to scholarly or debated topic
de- new sentence
φασὶ - they say (other scholars)
τῆ-for feminine, rhapsodia
Z- book 6 , with bar over the letter (means non alphabetic)
 ἡ προτέρα τοῦ ἀνδρὸς ἐπίπληξις- attributive position
οῦ ἀνδρὸς ἐπίπληξις- A’s criticism of hector at the gates


ἡδ’ αῦτις δμωῇσι αὔξει τὸ πάθ , τοσοῦτον γὰρ ἀπέχει τοῦ ἐννοεῖν τί τῶν συμβεβηκότων ὡς καὶ λουτρὰ τῷ ἀνδρὶ παρασκευάζειν μονονουχὶ ὁρῶσα τὸν Ἕκτορα διὸ καὶ (ἐπεφώνησεν ὁ ποιητὴς) τὸ  (νηπίη οὐδ’ ἐνόησεν) ὥσπερ ἐλεῶν τὴν ἄγνοιαν αὐτῆς
long horizontal line-parapgrafos, marks direct speech
αὔξει-we speak of the poet in present tense
 this comment increases the pathos
γὰρ
ἐννοεῖν - away from, with τοῦ , using genitvie as infinitive, speaker is so far from understanding τί , 
συμβεβηκότων- the things that have happened
ὡς καὶ - natural result clause, os plus inf. 
kai- adverbial
νηπίη οὐδ’ ἐνόησεν-quoted
this kind of direct address by the poet is uncommon
nepios in other contexts is perjoritvae, but here is pitying
μονονουχὶo-only because, practically, hasn’t quite
ουχὶ-emphatic
διὸ καὶ- for this reason, switching subject
τὸ-quoted phrases, like quotation marks
ὥσπερ ἐλεῶν - as if he were pitying her ignorance
she can all but see hector
oti- explains critical sign, cannonball symbol

ἀλλ' ἥ γ' ἱ̈στὸν ὕφαινε.
οτι ασυμπαθης η ανδρομαχῃ εν τοσουτω θορυβῳ κατ οικον ατρεμουσα και ταυτα (την αχιλλεως εφοδον) ουκ αγνοουσα ,
 εοικεν ουν φησιν ο αρισταρχ προκαταχρησαμενος ο ποιητης (τῳ της ανδρομαχης προσωπω) κατα την προς εκτορος κοινολογιαν απεσχισθαι νυν του προσωπου
and so she weaves her web/at her loom
οτι-because
lack of sympathy/feeling 
θορυβῳ-confusion
ατρεμουσα-being calm, not trembling
ταυτα?
not unknowing of the approach of Achilles
^^ problem diple is dealing with
aristarchus says poet probably completely made use of the character of andromache
the communication/dialogue (with hector?)
απεσχισθαι-m/p infinitive
even now
her countenance
ουν-explains problem
προκαταχρησαμενος-causal, because
not the moment to pause and explain who andromache is 
ἐζήτηται - it is debated
