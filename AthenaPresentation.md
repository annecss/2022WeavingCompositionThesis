Hera has decided to seduce her husband, Zeus, and convince him to let the Trojans, her favorites, win. Lines 159-223 describe Hera's process of adorning herself. In lines 178-180, Hera puts on a beautiful robe, crafted by the goddess Athena. This line and set of scholia describes the creation of that robe in more detail.
