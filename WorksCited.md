Bolling provides an etymological analysis of two important, but confusing termsas they are used in the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_. He explains thαt the nouns _ποικιλος_ and _θρονος_  refer not only to human-created decorative features, but to materials embedded with spiritual power.

Dickey's indispensable guide to ancient scholatship provides a general overivew of the flourishing field of anciet Greek textual commentary and specific information on major works, such as the known scholars of Homer. I relied on Chapter One, the "Introduction to Ancient Scholarship", Chapter 2 through 2.1.1.3 for its information on various sources of ancient scholarship on Homer, and Chapters 4 and 5 for assistance on learning the tricky scholarly Greek of the scholia and the accompanying practice materials. The appendices were also particularly helpful.
