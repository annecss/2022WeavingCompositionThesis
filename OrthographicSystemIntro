-citing orthographic system: not enough to say something is digital -they way a text is encoded should express the semantics of the text so that it can be tokenized -first token of Iliad: μηνιν, a leixcal token -funny fishtail: punctuation token, even if it looks like a comma plus semicolon, it just one token -tokens are not just charcters, but are always classified -for line of Iliad: create tokenized edition, add another level to citation hierarchy VA1.1.1: μηνιν analyze VA1.1.1 with orthographic system, it will tell you it is a lexical token TLG012-Homeric poetry 1-Iliad .msa -alt edition generated automatically: tlg12.tlgoo1.msadiplomatic, scribal for things like sic/corr -we have: orginal diplomatic edition, scribal version(acknowledigng scribes version, like with replaced words, or offering two readings(we take on on line as diplomatic, superscript as scirbal alternative)) modern editorial normalization(acknowleding unintellagible passages///misspellings, our own readings, connecting byzantine orthogrpahy with normal readings) -encoding multivalent (multiple possible readings) documents and generating univocal editions -strong feelings about using tei to get to something else -we use tei to encode the texts and get the univocal editions -can use univocal editoins reduce to text with no markup and cts urn
