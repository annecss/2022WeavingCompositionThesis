"True it is, Spinning with the Fingers is more proper to our Sexe, then studying or writing Poetry, which is the Spinning with the braine: but I having no skill in the Art of the first (and if I had, I had no hopes of gaining so much as to make me a Gar∣ment to keep me from the cold) made me delight in the latter; since all braines work naturally, and in∣cessantly, in some kinde or other; which made me en∣deavour to Spin a Garment of Memory, to lapp up my Name, that it might grow to after Ages"
