# Prospectus
## I.Introduction
-
Scholars have long recognized the importance of weaving to the ancient world, especially as the Iliad expresses. Far from the fast fashion of today, textiles were incredibly valuable for their beauty and for the intense labor that it took to create them.
I belive the scholia of the earliest survivng complete Iliad manuscripts will likely touch on the theme of weaving, due to the its importance, and I want to see if, and how, the scholiasts
recognize a connection between "women's work" weaving, and "men's work" singing epic songs.
## II.Literature Review/Knowledge Gap
-
I have already watched and reviewed the video by Greogry Nagy and Prudence Jones, which discusses the symbolism of textiles in the ancient world.
Elanor Dickey, Ancient Greek Scolarship.
My scholarship will fill the existing gap of work dealing with weaving as a topic in the scholia.
## III.Primary Sources
I will work with The Upsilon 1.1, Venetus B, and Escorial Manuscripts, which are freely available thanks to the Homer Multitext project. These 10th and 11th century manuscripts were copied by Byzantine scribes and survived in various monasteries across Europe.
## IV.Methodology
-
I will use the high resolution images of these manuscripts provided by the HMT image citation tool. I will use julia and pluto notebooks to edit diplomatic versions of these manuscripts and their scholia.
## V.Chapter outline
-
Chapter One: Abstract and Project Overview
Chapter 3: Literature Review of weaving in the Iliad
Chapter 4: List of weaving and epic terms I used
Chapter 5: Editions of the scholia of Books Three 31.125-28, Six, 12.427-438, and 22.441-448 that pertain to weaving, as well as the passage 9.189 where Achilles sings epic.
Chapter 6: Text model details
Chapter 7: Results and further directions for prroject
## VI.Timeline
-
My first task as a researcher will be to read closely the sections of the Iliad dealing with weaving, and accumulate a working list of weaving and poetic vocabulary. 
Next, I will edit those sections and their accompanying scholia into digital editions of the 10th and 11th century manuscripts. From there, I will then build different textual models with topic modelling and word vectors.
I will look primarily for two clusters of words, those dealing with weaving, and those dealing with epic composition.
If I have time, I will publish a translation of these scholia.
